Some of the current projects being worked on are:
•	Creating a VR app where you can experience visual impairments and how it effects your daily life.
•	An app that recreates historic locations so you can experience them for yourself.
•	An app that gets your location and shows you locations where the natives birds have been spotted and allow you to report your own sightings.
