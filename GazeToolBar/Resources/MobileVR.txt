Mobile Development
In the mobile development project you are given the opportunity to work with clients to create mobile applications that will be implemented in a real world situation. You will meet with clients on a regular basis and help them turn their ideas into a reality. The mobile team works with students from the design school. You will also be given the option to create your own virtual reality applications.
Some of the current projects being worked on are:
•	Creating a VR app where you can experience visual impairments and how it effects your daily life.
•	An app that recreates historic locations so you can experience them for yourself.
•	An app that gets your location and shows you locations where the natives birds have been spotted and allow you to report your own sightings.
