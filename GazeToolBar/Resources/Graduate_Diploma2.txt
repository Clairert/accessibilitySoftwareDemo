There are currently far more IT jobs than there are graduates and employers are desperate for individuals with a good understanding of the industry. Consider a career as a Programmer, Software Developer, Systems Administrator or Computing Services Manager, amongst many others.

Tailored to meet your requirements, create a customised path of study that focuses on your desired outcome. Specialist areas for IT graduates include interactive media, hardware, programming, databases, communications, business or networks/operating systems. Gain confidence in a supportive environment and enjoy the opportunity to integrate part-time learning into your busy schedule. Benefit from the small class sizes, allowing for one-on-one attention from experienced teachers, and the chance to practise your skills with a range of excellent equipment and applications.
